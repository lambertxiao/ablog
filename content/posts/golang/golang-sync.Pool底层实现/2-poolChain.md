poolChain是poolDequeue的动态大小版本，本质上也是个双向链表，特别之处在于，它每次出队的元素个数是前一次出队的两倍。一旦出队满了m

```go
// poolChain is a dynamically-sized version of poolDequeue.
//
// This is implemented as a doubly-linked list queue of poolDequeues
// where each dequeue is double the size of the previous one. Once a
// dequeue fills up, this allocates a new one and only ever pushes to
// the latest dequeue. Pops happen from the other end of the list and
// once a dequeue is exhausted, it gets removed from the list.
type poolChain struct {
	// head is the poolDequeue to push to. This is only accessed
	// by the producer, so doesn't need to be synchronized.
	head *poolChainElt

	// tail is the poolDequeue to popTail from. This is accessed
	// by consumers, so reads and writes must be atomic.
	tail *poolChainElt
}

type poolChainElt struct {
	poolDequeue

	// next and prev link to the adjacent poolChainElts in this
	// poolChain.
	//
	// next is written atomically by the producer and read
	// atomically by the consumer. It only transitions from nil to
	// non-nil.
	//
	// prev is written atomically by the consumer and read
	// atomically by the producer. It only transitions from
	// non-nil to nil.
	next, prev *poolChainElt
}
