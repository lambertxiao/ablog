### 块设备初始化

/*
 * NR_REQUEST is the number of entries in the request-queue.
 * NOTE that writes may use only the low 2/3 of these: reads
 * take precedence.
 *
 * 32 seems to be a reasonable number: enough to get some benefit
 * from the elevator-mechanism, but not so much as to lock a lot of
 * buffers when they are in the queue. 64 seems to be too many (easily
 * long pauses in reading when heavy writing/syncing is going on)
 */
#define NR_REQUEST	32

/*
 * Ok, this is an expanded form so that we can use the same
 * request for paging requests when that is implemented. In
 * paging, 'bh' is NULL, and 'waiting' is used to wait for
 * read/write completion.
 * 进程要想与块设备进行沟通，必须经过主机内存中的缓冲区，
 * request就是操作系统管理缓冲区中的缓冲块与块设备上逻辑块之间读写关系的数据结构
